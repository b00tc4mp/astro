# Astro Login / Register 

### Full Stack MERN Stack with Astro and React for Login/Registration with JWT and Express API CRUD and MongoDB Storage

This project demonstrates a full-stack web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js) with additional integration of Astro and JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication and authorization. The application encompasses both a front-end and back-end implementation:

### Front-end (Astro):

The front-end is built using Astro, a lightweight and performant JavaScript framework that leverages pre-rendering and other techniques for faster page loading and improved user experience.

It handles the user interface (UI) for both login and registration, providing an interactive and user-friendly interface for users to access the application.

Back-end (Express, Node.js, MongoDB):

The back-end is built using Express, a popular Node.js web application framework, and MongoDB, a NoSQL database.

It implements user authentication and authorization using JSON Web Tokens (JWT), ensuring secure access to the application's resources.

It provides a RESTful API (Application Programming Interface) that allows the front-end to interact with the database, performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on user data.

Key Features:

### Full-stack MERN stack implementation

Astro for a performant and lightweight front-end

JWT authentication and authorization for secure access

Express API for CRUD operations on user data in MongoDB

User login and registration functionality

Overall, this project showcases a comprehensive full-stack web application built with modern technologies, demonstrating proficiency in both front-end and back-end development.
